Dylan Applegate has learned the hard way that success is not guaranteed in this world, no matter how much natural talent one has. And make no mistake, on sheer talent alone, Dylan is considered a favorite in all Speegle National events, including the Wii Golf Masters. However, the field should be worried this year because Dylan has committed the offseason to unlocking his full potential. A combination of meditation, practice and training has Dylan back for his second Wii Golf Masters ready to show that he is deserving of the high praise and recognition bestowed upon him in the past.

        Winston Churchill once said, ‚ÄúSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.‚Äù Since being born in 1993, Chris Hicks has responded to both success and failure in the same way: relentless determination. After 25 years on this Earth, Chris may have met his most difficult challenge left: helping both lead in the vision of the Wii Golf Masters and competing for the majestic green jacket. His final round collapse last year has led to an offseason of personal, professional and spirtitual growth that brings Chris back to Speegle National with a focused determination.

              Alex Lightsey is looking the break the mold of what a Wii Golf Masters champion can look like.

Questions abound around this rookie‚Äôs approach to the game, but no one can argue with his qualifications. Before being invited to the Masters, Alex has had much success on the amateur circuit, and his training regimen shows an insatiable determination to show the rest of the field that this newcomer is here to stay.
